# C - The Father of High-Level Programming
Although many may view C as a more difficult language to learn, it is the father of high-level programming. C was the basis for many languages such as C++, Java, Python, Go, etc. 
C is mainly for low-level/performance-oriented work. It allows the programmer to attain full access to every part of a computer's hardware. Although many things in a different language would be easier to write, this level of hardware access is what keeps C a language worth learning.
### Common Uses for C :
  - Embedded Systems
  - High-Performance Software
  - Emulators/Virtual Machines
  - Operating System Development (Linux is written in C)
  - High-Level Programming Language Development
  - Device Drivers

# C++ - An Extension of C
C++ is the direct son of C. The syntax is the same and C++ inherits C functions but many things have been re-implemented around the idea of classes and objects. This way, low-level work is still possible but the code is much more organized and there are many things directly implemented by the language.
### Common Uses for C++ :
  - Game Development (Most game engines are written in C++)
  - Graphics Rendering and Animation
  - High-Performance Desktop Apps
  - Operating System Development
  - Mobile Apps

# Java - Focusing on Software
Java is a very interesting language and is a good position for many to start. It is high-level enough for one to virtually make anything in the language without it being too over-complicated. However, it is also verbose enough for one to understand every little thing that is going on within the code. It is a healthy level of abstraction for many to work with regularly. For example, in C/C++ where the programmer would have to manage the memory, Java's Garbage Collector automatically does this for them. Secondly, Java's Runtime is available on all operating systems thus making it naturally cross-platform. In Java, the focus is on efficiently creating software to be software as opposed to working with hardware.
### Common Uses for Java :
  - Mobile Apps (Android is founded upon Java)
  - Desktop GUI Applications (Easily Redistributable)
  - Cloud/Web/Internet-Based Applications (See [Cerebrum](https://github.com/albertbregonia/Cerebrum))
  - Enterprise Applications
  - Minecraft Mods/Plugins

# Python - The Full Spectrum
Python is one of the most popular and useful languages of today. It is used by a wide spectrum of people ranging from high school students to professional machine learning engineers. Python is truly a 'jack of all trades' kind of language. Its overall goal is to make programming easy and a lot of the time, it can be said that the focus is attaining the *results* of the software rather than the *software itself*. With a very simple syntax based around indentation and dynamic typing paired with the millions of community-sourced and built-in packages, writing any software in Python is largely easier compared to any other language. Albeit this is nice, compared to other languages, Python takes a massive performance hit. As Python is a very high-level language and many of the inner workings of the hardware and software are hidden from the programmer, it is one of the best programming languages to start with. 
#### ***In my opinion, Python is a language that is useful for all people; not only professionals***.
### Common Uses for Python :
  - Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/Deep Learning
  - Web-Backend Development
  - Penetration Testing
  - Data Science/Analysis
  - Automation of Tedious Tasks

# Go a.k.a Golang - The Son of them All
Go or Golang is the baby language of the rest. Born by Google Employees 10 years ago, the language was made out of the many appeals of each of the previously listed languages. It is similar to C/C++ as it is syntactically similar, relatively fast and memory-efficient, features pointers and memory references, compiles to a standalone binary and, allows for direct imports of C code. Golang also sports a C-Style attitude towards objects in the form of `structs`. It is similar to Java in which it features garbage collection/automatic memory management, albeit Golang's version is much faster. Lastly, it is similar to Python as Golang prides itself on having a very robust and powerful standard library, has a very readable syntax/code style and, is used for many of the same reasons. Golang's main appeal besides having the best traits of other languages is the fact that it is easy to write anything in the spectrum of computer science in Go. 
#### ***In my opinion, Go is a language to switch to; not learn first.***
### Common Uses for Go :
  - Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/Deep Learning
  - Cloud/Web-Backend Development
  - Multicore/Multithreaded High-Performance Software
  - Data Science/Analysis
  - DevOps

#### If you have reached this point and still cannot decide what language to learn, start with [Python](/Python/README.md). I say this because even if later on you decide that computer science isn't for you, Python is still useful for automating everyday tedious tasks, thus, making your life easier.
