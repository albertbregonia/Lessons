# Lessons in the Fundamentals of Computer Science
As a major proponent of computer literacy, I designed this large set of lessons and examples to allow anyone to gain a grasp on fundamental concepts of computer science. Choose a folder labeled with the language of your choice to get started.

***Note: By no means am I saying that I am a 'master' of any of these languages and know them to their 100% content. However, as one can tell by the many repositories and projects I have posted, I am by no means a beginner.***
#### *I am simply trying to teach computer science with the information that I wish I knew from the start.* 

# Choosing a Language
If you are a true beginner and have no clue as to what language you would like to learn first, [here are some descriptions](ChoosingALanguage.md).

# Syllabus
This course entails learning the very fundamentals of computer science. The course material for each lesson is relatively similar for each language with a few additions based on the presence of special features in a language.
- Lesson 1 - Syntax, Scope, Data-Types, Libraries
- Lesson 2 - Mathematics Random Number Generation and Operators
- Lesson 3 - Boolean Logic, Conditional Statements, Loops
- Lesson 4 - String Processing
- Lesson 5 - Arrays a.k.a Vectors and Matrices
- Lesson 6 - Functions
- Lesson 7 - Objects and Classes
- Lesson 8 - Inheritance
- Lesson 9 - Abstraction/Interfaces
- Lesson 10 - Introduction to Data Structures
# Other Notes
I also decided to create this repository in an attempt to reinforce my understanding of the fundamentals of all of the languages here. I will update this over time.
